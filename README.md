# Inbank loan calculator backend

***

## Description
I understood the task in such a way that I have to make one endpoint that returns how much a person can get a loan based on their credit score, i.e. the person enters the amount of the loan and the period of the loan and I find the credit score. Then I calculate the loan that the bank will return, that is, the loan multiplied by the credit score is the loan that the bank allows the person to give
